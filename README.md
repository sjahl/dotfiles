dotfiles
========


go away.


## 2019/12/30

I recently decided to wage some war on complexity. So I started most of my
dotfiles from scratch. These are pretty sparse, as I relized I didn't need a
heck of a lot of config (provided that I put an emphasis on choosing tools that
didn't need a lot of configuration, or worked mostly how I wanted out of the
box).
